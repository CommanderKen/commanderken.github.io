Countless words have already been spent on the importance and beauty of reading, so I won't go on about it. This is my very personal and semi-serious list of books that impressed me the most in 2024. The most observant among you will notice that these aren't books released this year. Don't be a pain, this is a list of books I *read* (or reread) this year that I enjoyed, not books *from this year*. The list is constantly updated until December 31, 2024.

### Dune

Let's start with a novel! With the theatrical release of the second part of Denis Villeneuve's [film adaptation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgcRr6cAh2E), I couldn't resist rereading Frank Herbert's masterpiece. I don't have much else to say except that it's my favorite science fiction novel and absolutely one of my favorite novels overall. Highly recommended! 10/10

For the occasion, I also read the sequel, Dune Messiah. It's not on par with the first one, but it's still worth reading.

### The Temple of the Golden Pavilion

Yes indeed, another novel. Perhaps one of the most famous works by master Yukio Mishima. It's an extremely fictionalized account of the 1950 burning of the [Golden Pavilion Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkaku-ji). Also highly recommended.

### Maniac

This is the book that impressed me the most this year so far. Labatut's writing made me fall in love with the story, or rather the stories: that of Paul Ehrenfest, that of John von Neumann, and that of world go champion Lee Sedol against the AI AlphaGo. A tale about the relationship between humans, science, and technology with reflections that hit me in the face like a punch and left me stunned. Absolutely unmissable!

### Napoleon's Buttons

A journey of discovery into chemistry through 17 chapters that tell the stories of 17 molecules without shying away from more technical aspects (always at a popular science level) such as nomenclature and chemical structure. This was a (**much appreciated**) gift!

### The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation

Despite the title, the text is not *new*. The book is in fact from 1958, but it sheds new light on the art of rhetoric, understood here not as mere embellishment of discourse, but as the ability to argue rationally. I studied it for an exam and I feel it deserves a read.

### The Meaning of It All

This is a collection of lectures given by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). Some very interesting, others less so. I included it because it's Feynman, can't be missed!

### The Big Short

I've rewatched the [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)) a million times and I absolutely love it. Finally this year I read the book and it didn't disappoint. If you liked the movie, you'll like the book too. If you haven't even seen the movie, you need to fix that. Also because it helps understand the dynamics of one of the most important events of the last 20 years. Plus I have a soft spot for true stories, and this book closely follows real events. Highly recommended!

### Deep Work

This is a must for anyone who wants to understand how to concentrate and how to perform quality intellectual work. Absolutely essential. In the future I'd like to dedicate a separate post to it.

### In Defense of Lost Causes

Žižek is simply incredible. Here he tackles the theme of revolutions and totalitarianisms, trying to recover the "lost causes," that is, those revolutionary themes that have been abandoned by contemporary neoliberal narrative. Absolutely must-read.

### Storia del Medio Oriente contemporaneo

A book to better understand the current situation in the Middle East. The text starts from the 1800s and goes almost to the present day, and despite the title, it covers not only the Middle East geographical area, but also Anatolia, the Persian Gulf, and North Africa.
